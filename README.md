# Dad Joke Bot

This bot is a simple .NET 5 Console app that fetches a new Dad joke from https://icanhazdadjoke.com every 30 seconds, outputs this to a text file and plays a sound.

## Getting Started

The sound file is included in the project, so in order to use this, all you need to do in OBS, or streaming software of choice, is add a text source from file, that points to joke.txt found in <projectpath>/bin/Debug/net5.0/joke.txt

Then when you are streaming, ensure the application is running in the background and enjoy the laughs! :)
